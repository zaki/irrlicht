Checklist for Irrlicht developers for doing releases.

- PRE-BUILD TESTS:
- - Run tests in the tests folder
- - Compile and run all examples for testing (preferably on all platforms, 
compilers, settings ... until you are certain enough stuff works sufficiently). 
Ask for help for platforms which you don't own.
- - Compile the tools on all platforms you have. Note that some tools are in the buildall-examples VS project files on Windows, but on Linux 
command line you have to compile them individually.

- VERSION UPDATES:
- - check IRRLICHT_SDK_VERSION (in IrrCompileConfig.h)
- - check version number in the Makefile
- - update readme.txt (version number, supported compilers)
- - Add new release information (date+version-number) in changes.txt
- - go through folders if other .txt files still make sense (things change and updating those files tends to be forgotten)

- BUILDING THE RELEASE
- - run a clean build for buildAllExamples in the examples folder with the 
target compiler for 32-bit and for release (preferably oldest supported VS 
compiler, otherwise oldest you have still installed)
- - when possible compile the dll for MinGW on Windows (in release and with -s for smaller size)
- - when possible compile the dll for 64 bit (again with Visual Studio and release)
- - run makedocumentation in scripts\doc\irrlicht
- - create a target directory, like irrlicht-1.8.1 for example
- - svn export to the target directory
- - copy the subfolders of doctemp into the doc folder of the target directory
- - copy all .exe files (except test.exe) from bin\Win32-VisualStudio (.pdb's are not necessary)
- - copy Irrlicht.dll from bin\Win32-visualstudio 
- - copy the files in lib\Win32-visualstudio
- - copy Irrlicht.dll from bin\Win64-VisualStudio 
- - copy the files in lib\Win64-visualstudio 
- - copy Irrlicht.dll from bin\Win32-gcc 
- - copy the files in lib\Win32-gcc
- - remove the tests folder
- - remove scripts folder (if the release comes with docs, if you do a release 
without docs for smaller filesizes then the script folder has to stay in).
- - create a zip file 
- - figure out how to fix unix access right for shell-scripts in the zip file (my 
trick so far is: unzip in Linux, set +x for all .sh files, zip again)

RELEASING:
- - upload the zip-file somewhere, then download it again on all platforms and do 
  another quick test with that file (do examples still run, can you compile)
- - give the link to the zip out on the mailinglist for others to look at
- - Upload new documentation (the content of doc/html) to: web.sourceforge.net 
  (sftp protocol, user and passwd are your sourceforge account, the folder 
  might not be shown - but you can still cd into it!):
  /home/project-web/i/ir/irrlicht/htdocs 
  Best create first a folder with a new name, copy stuff in there, test (just 
  check the website), rename old folder and give new folder the "docu" name. 
  Then you can delete the old folder if you want.
- - upload the zip by logging in to sourceforge and using the "Files" menu (needs 
	admin privileges and it's the 'Files' menu between 'Summary' and 'Reviews'). 
	The target is in one of the Irrlicht SDK subfolders. Then click the "i" beside 
	the file and "select all" to make it the active download.
- - write a forum post, tell everyone in facebook, reddit, your friends...
- - login to wordpress at http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/wp-login.php, update the 
	downloads section and write a release post.
